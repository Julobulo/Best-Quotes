# Best Quotes

Welcome to "Best Quotes", a project I made for fun! Check out more of my work on [jules.tf](https://jules.tf).

This website is designed to provide you with a collection of the most inspiring quotes, written and voted by the community.

## Functionalities

### Different tabs

Users can choose between several tabs, including "random" (the quotes are chosen at random in the backend), "best" (only the quotes with the most likes will appear) and "new" (the most recently posted quotes).

### Upvotes and downvotes

It is very easy to upvote or downvote a quote using the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to the right of each quote. This allows for the best quotes to be easily found, as they get the most likes.

### Writing your own quote

I made it very easy for you to write your very own quote! You can even specify your twitter handle so that users can find you on twitter if they like your quote!

## Tech stack
This website was made with the following technologies:
- Vite: to kickstart this project
- React: to easily create reusable components
- Tailwind css: allows for a very complicated and responsive styling with minimal effort
- Node & Express: to create a backend API
- MongoDB: to store all the quotes and information associated with it
